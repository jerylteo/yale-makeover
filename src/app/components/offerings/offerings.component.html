          <div class="py-4">
            <p class="text-xs leading-6">The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School of Art. It is conferred by the University upon recommendation of the faculty after successful completion of all course work in residence and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the faculty. It implies distinctive achievement on the part of students in studies in the professional area of their choice and demonstrated capacity for independent work. The minimum residence requirement is two years. All candidates’ work is reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory, the student may not be invited back to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic Regulations in the chapter General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present at the Commencement exercises in May unless excused by the dean.</p> 
            <p class="text-xs leading-6 mt-4">Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. The disposition of these credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the time of registration between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.</p>

            <p class="text-xs leading-6">Each department has its own visitor program in which professionals from outside the School are invited to lecture to students or take part in critiques.</p>            
            <p class="text-xs leading-6 mt-4">The School also facilitates a public all-school lecture program in which ideas of general and cross-disciplinary importance are explored by visiting artists and members of the faculty in events typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to the public.</p>            
            <p class="text-xs leading-6 mt-4">The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and at 32 Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery is open to the public when exhibitions are scheduled, but open hours vary by semester. The 32 Edgewood Gallery is open during limited hours for specific exhibitions and events.
